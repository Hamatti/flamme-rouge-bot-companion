# Flamme Rouge Bot Companion

[Use it here](https://flamme-rouge-bot-companion.netlify.app/)

[Flamme Rouge](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199478/flamme-rouge/) is a wonderful cycling-themed racing table top game. Its Peloton expansion provided rules and components for playing with bots (for solo gaming or when playing with a friend) but playing those gets tedious as you have to shuffle multiple decks, draw one by one and manage multiple bot teams.

Say hello to **Flamme Rouge Bot Companion** which is a web app you can use on browser to add multiple teams and advance round-by-round. It will show you which cards the bots drew and you can move their cyclists on the board accordingly.

## Dev Notes

This app is created with Create React App and you can run it in local mode with

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

which will start a new development server on localhost:3000.

## Ideas for improvement

[] Add option to choose team colors for easier matching between cards and cyclists
